# diSiac Website

The new diSiac Website isn't currently live yet.

## About The App

The diSiac Dance Company Website is a comprehensive full-stack web application built to enhance the online presence of Princeton's diSiac Dance Group. With a significant increase in website speed by over 100% compared to its predecessor, the site offers tailored access control, providing specific interfaces for admins, members, and general viewers. The application features a user-friendly REST API, allowing authenticated users the ability to manage group members, and create, modify or delete entries related to past or upcoming shows, and media. This greatly simplifies future application maintenance. Additionally, the introduction of user authentication through Google Authentication ensures that sensitive information is accessible only to authorized members, thereby adding an extra layer of security and control.

## Technologies

We used `TypeScript`, `React`, `Next.js`, `Tailwind CSS`, `Prisma`, `PostgreSQL`, `Cloudinary`, `HTML`, `CSS`

## Status

The new diSiac website will be live once the database, which is managed by current diSiac members, is fully populated with all necessary information.
